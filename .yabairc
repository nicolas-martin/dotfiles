# Configure the layout mode
# "stack" - is what I use, keeps a single app on the front
# "bsp" - binary space partitioning enables automatic tiling (partitioning)
# "float" - default mode, windows are not managed
yabai -m config layout stack
# yabai -m config layout bsp
# yabai -m config layout float


# THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
# It ensures that when I restart yabai, all the rules (including the manage=off rules)
# are reapplied to existing windows
# Otherwise yabai takes care of management and I couldnt resize apps like
# packet tracer for example
yabai -m rule --apply
